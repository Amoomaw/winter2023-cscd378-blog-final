Alexander's Site research:

Blog sites typically are composed of these features:

A standardized font for all pages
Engaging, relevant topics
Newsletters to keep people coming back


Here is an example blog:
https://blog.hubspot.com/?hubs_content=blog.hubspot.com%25252F&hubs_content-cta=blog-nav-card--media-card&hubs_post-cta=blognavcard-website

We see that there are numerous topics to read about whether it be sales, marketing, or even website building tips.
What's also interesting is there appears to be a login option for the website, which I've found to be a common feature for the more popular blog sites.
Above all, we see a standardized format for each page. I believe this is the most important aspect of a website to keep users engaged.
Given the overall description of the page, I believe it is important to note the relevancy why the specific features are displayed on this page.
We see a "featured posts" option. I believe this engages users who want to only read the most up-to-date topics.
Below each topic, we see a date and name of the author.
Each topic is split into its own section to allow users to easily see which topic they want to read.


Here is another example blog:
https://www.vice.com/en/topic/vice-blog

This website has a very similar format. The topics are clearly defined underneath the title of each post, as well as the date and author.
There looks to be pictures for each blog post. There is an option to share each post to your social media network. There is also a newsletter sign-up option.
The most interesting part of this blog is there are tags at the bottom of each post indicating the topics discussed within the post.
For example, I clicked on a family guy blog post, at the bottom of the page there were tags like:
COMEDY TV CARTOON REVIEWS FAMILYGUY OPINION VIEWSMYOWN VICEBLOG SETHMACFARLANE BADTV
If we were to click on any of these options, there would be a whole section of posts relating to the specified option.
